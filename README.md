HT16D35A_Arduino_Library
===========
# Introduction
The HT16D35A/HT16D35B are high accuracy constant current and memory mapping LED display controller/drivers.
The maximum display capacity of the devices is 224 patterns composed of 28 rows and 8 commons.
The devices can generate a 64 step Gray Scale (PWM data) using software controlled PWM circuitry and 64 LED illumination levels using software controlled PWM circuitry.

# Usage
this library is still unfinished

~~Download the .zip file from Github, in Arduino go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library... and select the downloaded .zip file.
The library example can then be opened under File -> Examples -> HT16D35A LED Driver~~
